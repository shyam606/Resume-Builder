Next.js Resume Builder

A dynamic and customizable Resume Builder built using Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Ant Design.
Users can create, preview, and download resumes with theme customization and multiple templates.


Features

1.Built with Next.js (App Router) and TypeScript

2.Light/Dark theme toggle support

3.Two elegant resume templates to choose from

4.Real-time preview while editing

5.Download resume as PDF

6.Responsive and clean UI using Tailwind CSS and Ant Design

7.Data managed via React Context API


Approach

The project is structured using a global ResumeContext to manage all user data such as skills, education, projects, and achievements.
Data is dynamically rendered into different templates.
Theme switching and template selection features allow users to personalize their resume easily.

Tech Stack

1.Next.js 15

2.TypeScript

3.Tailwind CSS
